# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview 
The purpose of this module is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type and create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type to show how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer
## Results 

The first image is all the data for PyBer based on city type.

Based of this analysis, I have discovered some findings: 

- Urban cities have the highest demand for total rides
- Urban cities have the highest demand for total drivers
- Urban cities have the highest amount of total fares
- Rural cities have the highest amount of average fares per ride 
- Rural cities have the highest amount of avergae fares per driver

The second image is a chart showing the total fares by city type

## Summary
Here are three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types: 
1. Increase the amount of drivers in Rural cities because so that the demand is met and therefore the amount of rides to drivers will be closer to equilibrium.
2. Decrease the amount of drivers in Urban cities because there are more drivers than rides and that is why fares are lower per ride and per driver 
3. Encourage more drivers to ride between end of February to mid-March because you can see a peak in total fares in all three city types around that date.
